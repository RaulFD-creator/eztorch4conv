# Architectures
Architectures module within eztorch4conv library. It contains the basic classes necessary to construct
DNN and MC-DNN models with Pytorch in a simple and efficient way. Classes are specifically designed
to create DCNN and MC-DCNN models, though they are general enough that they can be used for any kind of 
model.
